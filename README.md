# STAG Kernel Density Estimation Experiments
This repository contains code to perform experiments with the STAG kernel
density estimation module.

The experiments are split into two parts:
- kde-experiments: comparison of the STAG kernel density estimation implementation with other KDE algorithms.
- similarity-graph-experiments: experiments with the STAG approximate_similarity_graph method for spectral clustering.

Each of the corresponding directories contains a README file which describes how to run the experiments and plot
the results.
